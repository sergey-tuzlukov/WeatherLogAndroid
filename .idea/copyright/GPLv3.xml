    <option name="notice" value="WeatherLog is an app for logging air temperature changes and calculating&#10;total time of preset limits exceeding in the nearest past. The project&#10;began as a way to help moto-bikers decide if it is safe to drive in the morning&#10;after cold night, or for automobile owners to decide if it is time to change tires&#10;to/from winter ones. It also may be useful when man thinks about clothes/shoes&#10;to dress in this time, or in all other cases when there needs to analyze&#10;temperature's behaviour.&#10;&#10;Copyright Â© 2015 Sergey Tuzlukov &lt;s.tuzlukov@ya.ru&gt;.&#10;&#10;&#10;This file is part of WeatherLog.&#10;&#10;WeatherLog is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify&#10;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#10;the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or&#10;(at your option) any later version.&#10;&#10;WeatherLog is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#10;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#10;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
