/*
 * WeatherLog is an app for logging air temperature changes and calculating
 * total time of preset limits exceeding in the nearest past. The project
 * began as a way to help moto-bikers decide if it is safe to drive in the morning
 * after cold night, or for automobile owners to decide if it is time to change tires
 * to/from winter ones. It also may be useful when man thinks about clothes/shoes
 * to dress in this time, or in all other cases when there needs to analyze
 * temperature's behaviour.
