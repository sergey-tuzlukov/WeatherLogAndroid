<!--
  ~ WeatherLog is an app for logging air temperature changes and calculating
  ~ total time of preset limits exceeding in the nearest past. The project
  ~ began as a way to help moto-bikers decide if it is safe to drive in the morning
  ~ after cold night, or for automobile owners to decide if it is time to change tires
  ~ to/from winter ones. It also may be useful when man thinks about clothes/shoes
  ~ to dress in this time, or in all other cases when there needs to analyze
  ~ temperature's behaviour.
